## About Us

Aspen Web Development is currently operated solely by [Dave Nielsen](https://dhniels.com). I am based out of Cedar City, Utah, but can take work from anywhere in the world. My one-on-one, personalized approach provides maximum value.

My philosophy is pay once for quality work that doesn't have to be redone again in a year. I don't believe in low-grade freelance work that you end up saving a few dollars, but are left in the cold moving forward once the work is delivered.

I love things with lasting value and support and aim to provide that for my clients as well. I want us both to have a mutually beneficial relationship that pays dividends even after the project is over.
